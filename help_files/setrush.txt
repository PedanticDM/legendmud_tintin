Sets the rush trigger response.

Usage:
    setrush <rush response>

Examples:
    setrush rage %1 - rages at the rushing mob
    setrush resc %2 - rescues the victim
    setrush st\;rage %1 - stands, then rages at the rushing mob
    setrush entrance %1 - entrances the rushing mob
    setrush #NOP - sets the rush trigger to do nothing

There is a built-in trigger that will detect any mob rushing at a target that is not you. Whether that be by throwing, shooting, or whatever other possible reason.

This command will set the response that you want to automatically invoke when the trigger triggers.

The %1 identifier matches the rushing mob and the %2 identifier matches the victim.

If you want to do multiple actions within the rush response, you must escape the delimiter (;) with the \ character (e.g. \;).

If you want the rush response to do nothing, use "setrush #NOP".
