Changes the nickname for a room.

Usage:
    rname <nickname>

Examples:
    rname jb
    rname stag

This updates the nickname of a room in the mapper. Nicknames are used in a number of other aliases to make it easy to reference a room in the map.

NOTE: All changes made to the map will be lost if you replace the map with any new updates.

If you want to add your own personalized nicknames to the map without losing them, you can do the following.
Go to the room you want to add a nickname to and type `#map info`. Take note of the Room vnum.

Open a custom module that you've added and add the following line to it:
    #MAP at <room vnum> {rname <nickname>};

You can use this feature to make nicknames for your house locations for easier travels.
