Finds a room based on the specified nickname and teleports you to it.

Usage:
    search <nickname>

Examples:
    search jb
    search stag
    search falcon

This command can be convenient if the map is not accurately showing your location and you know you're at a nicknamed room.

Most of the time, however, the `find` alias will be more convenient.
