Automatically interacts with the tform mob in Tara.

Usage:
    ttform <eq_name>
    ttform 2.<eq_name>

This command will automatically ask the tform mob about trueform, remove the specified eq, give the eq to the tform mob, and wear the eq once given back.

You may run into issues re-wearing items that can be worn in multiple slots.
These will have to be manually worn.

NOTE: You must give the money to the tform mob first before you can start using this alias.
