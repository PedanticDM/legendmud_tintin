Finds a room based on the specified nickname and walks to it if a path is found.
Map moves to final room slowly.

Usage:
    walk <nickname>

Examples:
    walk jb
    walk stag
    walk falcon

This alias will find a room based on the specified nickname if the nickname exists. It will then try to find a path to that room from the current room and walk you to it. The map will update slowly to try and match the speed that you are moving through rooms.

NOTE: If you want to send commands to be run after you get to the destination, make sure the map is at the destination. If the map is still updating the location, it will send those commands at the location the map was in when you sent the command.
